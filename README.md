# Project Overview
In this project, you will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. 
census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.
You will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, you will apply a series of transformations
and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. You will then evaluate several supervised 
learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, you will optimize
the model you've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. Finally, you will explore the chosen model and
its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

# Project Highlights
This project is designed to get you acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and
to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is
important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one
should be avoided.
Things you will learn by completing this project:
* How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
* How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
* What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
* How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

# Description
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide
financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters sent to people in the community,
CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually.
To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only
those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board
to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be 
evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation
yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
